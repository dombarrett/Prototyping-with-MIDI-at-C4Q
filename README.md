# Prototyping-with-MIDI-at-C4Q
Repository for the code, links, and information for my Prototyping with MIDI workshop at C4Q on 8/21/2018

Link to [slides are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1INr97NUgOPzu2Zr793hx_hHhNEr8df-NGDx_x5dilCI/edit?usp=sharing)

Link to [example p5js Javascript program is here](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/dbarrett/sketches/HJhBG-LI7)

[http://alpha.editor.p5js.org](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org) is an online editor that gives you blank templates for p5js sketches. Sign up is easy, and when you have an account you can copy/edit posted sketches (like mine above) and upload your own files (audio, image, etc) to be used in your sketches.


A copy of the p5js will be hosted this this repository, as well as the Arduino sketch that will be loaded onto the Teensy LC microcontrollers.
